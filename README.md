In 2022, Leukemia is the world leading cancer case as measured by the age-standardized rate (ASR) 
incidence and mortality index in children and adolescents. To identify and predict the ASR incidence and 
mortality of Leukemia in our subject group, this study uses statistical and several machine learning 
approaches, namely Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Regression Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Moreover, the models were evaluated using the following evaluation 
metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Symmetrical Mean 
Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Mean Relative Absolute Error (MRAE).The statistical and 
machine learning approaches that scores best based on the aforementioned evaluation metrics will be 
subject to further analysis. After thorough evaluation, thhe GLM and XGBoost are selected as the best 
performing prediction model for the ASR incidence, achieving the lowest SMAPE and MRAE score 
36.273% and 35.870%, respectively. Meanwhile, Random Forest is selected as the best performing 
prediction model for the ASR mortality, by achieving the lowest SMAPE and MRAE score 37.733% and 
MRAE score 28.395%, respectively. Upon further analysis, this study employs the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) method to determine the impact of each factor on both prediction models. 
However, the analysis indicates an unsatisfactory outcome due to several factors, including the number 
of missing values and the small number of variables used in this study.
